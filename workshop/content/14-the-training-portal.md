title: The training portal
---

The `Training Portal` is a Kubernetes custom resource, so one can use Kubernetes client
to get details about the resource:

```terminal:execute
command: kubectl get trainingportal
```

Or the full yaml with all the configuration it contains:

```terminal:execute
session: 2
command: kubectl get trainingportal educates-cli -o yaml
```
