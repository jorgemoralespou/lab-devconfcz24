title: Authoring Workshops

You can use Educates to deploy workshops published by others, but to get the
most from Educates you are more likely going to want to create your own
workshops. You could also use it to create a simple mechanism to deploy
application demos or test environments.

To create the skeleton for a new workshop using the CLI, run the command:

```terminal:execute
command: educates new-workshop lab-demo-workshop --title "Demo Workshop" --description "Workshop to demo use of Educates."
```

To view the set of files created run:

```terminal:execute
command: tree lab-demo-workshop
```
