title: Packaging Mechanism
---

Numerous packaging and installation mechanisms exist for applications to be
deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. Probably the most well known is Helm
templates. For Educates, we use an alternative packaging and installation
mechanism utilizing the [Carvel](https://carvel.dev/) tool set.

The Carvel tool set consists of a number of different tools which perform tasks
such as vendoring (`vendir`), YAML templating (`ytt`), container image
resolution and pinning (`kbld`), and Kubernetes application deployment (`kapp`).

Used together these tools provide a very powerful and flexible system for
distributing and installing packages for Kubernetes.

To make it much easier to install Educates to your local computer, but also in a
hosted Kubernetes cluster, Educates provides it's own CLI which bundles up the
functionality of the Carvel tools so you do not need to install them on your
computer to install Educates.

In the case of installing Educates to your local computer, the CLI is even able
to create a local Kubernetes cluster for you using Kind into which Educates is
then installed.

In this workshop we will use the CLI to install Educates into the Kubernetes
virtual cluster allocated to your workshop session.
