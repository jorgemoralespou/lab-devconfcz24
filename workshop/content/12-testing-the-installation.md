title: Testing the Installation
---

To test that the installation was successful we can deploy a workshop. For this
we will use a previously published workshop by running the command:

```terminal:execute
command: educates deploy-workshop -f https://github.com/vmware-tanzu-labs/lab-k8s-fundamentals/releases/latest/download/workshop.yaml
```

To access the training portal service and browse the workshops hosted by it,
run the command:

```terminal:execute
command: educates browse-workshops
```

When the training portal service is ready, this should automatically open a new
web browser window. Unfortunately though this doesn't work reliably when using
the command inside the terminal of an Educates workshop session due to browser
popup restrictions, it should however work were you running it in a terminal on
your local machine.

For this workshop session therefore, open the following URL:

```dashboard:open-url
url: http://educates-cli-ui.{{< param session_hostname >}}
```

When prompted for an access code, enter in the password obtained by running:

```terminal:execute
command: educates view-credentials
```

**NOTE:** If you did access the workshop via the `browse-workshop` command, 
or the URL url that it prints or clicked on the popup blocker and got in that way, 
the code has already been injected in the URL.
