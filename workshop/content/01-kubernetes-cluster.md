title: Kubernetes Cluster
---

The full Educates training platform requires a Kubernetes cluster in which to
run. There are more options, but we're going to focus on the most common one, running
Educates on a Kubernetes cluster.

Educates provides an opinionated installer to get you up and running on many flavours 
of Kubernetes clusters which include, Kind to run Educates on your own computer, 
or a hosted Kubernetes cluster such as EKS (AWS), GKE (GCP) or AKS (Azure). 
But, you can also use a custom Kubernetes cluster you have installed yourself to an IaaS or your own compute hardware.

In this workshop we will be deploying to a Kubernetes virtual cluster created
for you for this event. As we share a big cluster for every attendee of this workshop,
we provide a virtual cluster as working area for each of your sessions, so that you can experience the whole shebang.

In other words, we are using Educates itself to teach you about installing
and authoring with Educates.
